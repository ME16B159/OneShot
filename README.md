# OneShot
clg.js is the code
clg details, similiarclgs1,2,3,4 are all snapshots of output
without no prior knowledge it wasn't an easy task learning and coding these within about four days. 
I picked up mongo and node pretty quickly, however was not able to display the resuts through react as requested within the given time.
With time I would be able to do it ofcourse thus I request you to consider.
Hoping the main idea about using react was to make it visually appealing and testing the creative design capabilities, 
i have attached other posters I had made for my previous internship works. 
Hope it can relay to you my ability to make visually pleasing designs.
